  <h3>A Second Home</h3>
  <p>Kashima, Japan. A city in the Ibaraki Prefecture. That is where my grandmother lives. Where my mother is from. I have been visiting almost every year since I was born, and it feels like a sort of second home. Most of my trips there have been about a month long, and during summer breaks. My most recent trip however, was in the winter of 2024. I spent the entirety of winter break there, and plan to do the same this winter break. Since Japan is an island country, it can get extremely hot and humid during the summer months, making it difficult to be outside for extended periods of time. In the winter, this is not an issue at all, which is nice. Unlike winter in Michigan, which is usually unbearably cold and cloudy most days, winter in Japan looks more like sunny days and temperatures in the 40s. This only applies to the Tokyo area and Kashima though, as the northernmost region of Japan, Hokkaido, receives heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures during the winter. In recent years, going to Japan for vacation has become a sort of trend, which I have mixed feelings about. On one hand, it’s great that so many people are interested in the country and culture, and it's helping the Japanese economy a lot. However, many places in Japan are dealing with overtourism, as it is a small country. It’s strange to me because the country is simply where my family on my mother’s side lives, and I have been visiting my whole life for that reason, and I don’t understand why the country became a trend. It's disheartening sometimes to hear people talk about the country like it’s an amusement park.</p>
