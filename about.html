            <p><div class="img-container"></div> My name is Ike Conner, and I am from Novi, Michigan. I am a senior at Michigan State University, and I have an interest in both Web Development and User Experience. I am an Information Science major, with a focus on Human-Centered Technologies. I have done a web development summer camp when I was younger, but I did not develop a serious interest in web development until my time at MSU. In MI 472, a Digital Business and Commerce class, one of the assignments was to create a portfolio website. However, in this class, all we did was download and edit website templates in Adobe Dreamweaver. Which was fine for that class, but I wanted to actually know how to make a website myself, so I enrolled in MI 349, Web Design and Development. As for my interest in UX, it began after taking MI 350, which was Evaluating Human-Centered Technologies. After assessing various applications and websites for usability and accessibility, I realized that I found user experience very interesting. As for hobbies, I like to work out in my spare time. I am also a music producer, and I enjoy making instrumentals for artists. I hope to develop meaningful technologies for people, and create meaningful music.</p>
